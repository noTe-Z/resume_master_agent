# Resume Tailoring Agent - Product Management Document

## Overview

The Resume Tailoring Agent is an AI-powered system that helps job seekers customize their resumes based on specific job descriptions. This functionality will be triggered by a "Tailor Resume" button in the application interface.

## Objective

Create an automated system that:
1. Parses uploaded resume PDFs
2. Analyzes job descriptions
3. Dynamically generates tailored resumes with content prioritized for relevance
4. Provides an intuitive interface for reviewing and modifying tailored resumes

## Key Functionalities

### 1. PDF Resume Parsing
- Extract structured information from user-uploaded PDF resumes
- Parse sections (summary, education, experience, skills)
- Maintain formatting information for later reconstruction
- Handle different resume layouts and structures

### 2. Job Description Analysis
- Extract key requirements, skills, and responsibilities from job descriptions
- Identify critical keywords and qualification patterns
- Determine primary and secondary priorities for tailoring

### 3. Relevance Matching & Scoring
- Score each resume experience section based on relevance to job description
- Identify gaps between job requirements and resume content
- Generate optimization suggestions for tailoring

### 4. Content Selection & Ordering
- Select most relevant experiences for the target job
- Determine optimal ordering of experiences based on relevance scores
- Highlight transferable skills that match job requirements
- Suggest section reordering for maximum impact

### 5. Resume Modification Interface
- Intuitive UI for reviewing tailored resume content
- Interactive section reordering capabilities
- Experience selection/deselection functionality
- Real-time preview of tailored resume

## Technical Implementation Plan

### PDF Parsing Component
```python
# High-level pseudocode for PDF parsing module
def parse_resume_pdf(file_path):
    # Extract text from PDF
    raw_text = extract_text_from_pdf(file_path)
    
    # Identify sections using pattern recognition
    sections = identify_resume_sections(raw_text)
    
    # Parse structured data from each section
    structured_data = {
        'summary': parse_summary(sections.get('summary', '')),
        'education': parse_education(sections.get('education', '')),
        'experience': parse_experience(sections.get('experience', '')),
        'skills': parse_skills(sections.get('skills', ''))
    }
    
    return structured_data
```

### Relevance Matching Component
```python
# High-level pseudocode for relevance matching
def score_experience_relevance(experience_items, job_description):
    # Extract key terms from job description
    job_terms = extract_key_terms(job_description)
    
    # Score each experience item
    scored_items = []
    for item in experience_items:
        relevance_score = calculate_relevance(item, job_terms)
        scored_items.append({
            'item': item,
            'score': relevance_score
        })
    
    # Sort by relevance score
    return sorted(scored_items, key=lambda x: x['score'], reverse=True)
```

## User Experience Flow

1. User selects a job from their saved list
2. User clicks "Tailor Resume" button
3. System prompts for resume upload (if not already uploaded)
4. System analyzes resume and job description
5. System presents initial tailored resume with recommended modifications
6. User reviews and adjusts tailored content through the UI
7. User finalizes and downloads the tailored resume

## Future Enhancements

1. **AI-powered content suggestions**
   - Automatic generation of bullet points for experience sections
   - Suggested skill additions based on job requirements

2. **Multi-resume support**
   - Managing multiple base resumes for different career paths
   - A/B testing of different resume versions

3. **Integration with application tracking**
   - Analytics on which resume versions perform better
   - Suggestions based on successful applications
